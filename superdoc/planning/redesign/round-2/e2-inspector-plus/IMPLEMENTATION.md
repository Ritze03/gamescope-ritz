# E2 — implementation log

What has actually been built in C++, phase by phase, and what a later phase can
rely on. `SPEC.md` and `API.md` remain the contract; this file records where the
code *departed* from them and why, so the next agent does not have to
re-derive it.

Phase plan: `../../AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS.md` D10. Judgement calls taken during
P1: the same file, D11.

## 2026-08-23 — P1, the kit foundation

**Status: new code only. Nothing here is called by the running UI.** The only
existing files touched are `src/meson.build` and `tests/meson.build`, both for
build wiring.

### Where it lives, and why there

`src/Overlay/UI/` — the location `API.md`'s own "Proposed location" section
names, together with the filenames it lists. Deviating would have made every
path in the contract wrong on day one.

| File | What it owns | ImGui? |
|---|---|---|
| `Tokens.h/.cpp` | geometry, spacing scale, type roles, `display_scale`, motion | **no** |
| `Lane.h/.cpp` | SPEC §2.1's four columns, as pure arithmetic | no |
| `Row.h/.cpp` | `RowCtx` — the one right-bound allocator | ImRect only |
| `Band.h/.cpp` | SPEC §4.2's n × 44 composite band rule | ImRect only |
| `Registry.h/.cpp` | `Area` / `Entry` / `Parameter`, the four laws | **no** |
| `Colors.h/.cpp` | SPEC §7.1's colour roles | yes (accent is hue-live) |
| `Controls.h/.cpp` | the control atoms | yes |

**Why the split runs along the ImGui line.** Everything with real arithmetic or
a real rule in it is free of an ImGui context, a font atlas and the overlay's
live-theme globals. That is what makes the laws and the lane cheap to test —
`tests/test_overlay_ui.cpp` needs no window. Only the two files that pick
colours and hand rects to stock ImGui primitives need a context, and those are
covered by a headless harness (`tests/test_overlay_atoms.cpp`).

### The four laws, and where each is enforced

| Law | Enforced | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Prefix Law** (§5.2 cl. 2) | construction | `Param()` takes a *leaf*; the id is synthesised as `<parent>.<leaf>` and there is no other route. Re-checked in `Registry::SelfTest()` so a test can observe it. |
| **One Level** (§5.2 cl. 3) | **compile time** + runtime | `Parameter` has no nesting operation; its `.Param()` is a *sibling* factory on the parent Entry. A dot in a leaf — the only way to smuggle nesting into an id — is a runtime violation. |
| **Six Budget** (§5.2 cl. 3) | registration | the 7th `.Param()` reports `Law::SixBudget` and is not added. |
| **id uniqueness** | registration | one registry-wide claim list; areas, entries and params share the namespace, because the palette and `ui_snapshot` address all three by id. |
| **`Help()` required** (§5.2 cl. 1) | call + `SelfTest()` | empty/null text fires at the call; *never called at all* can only be decided once registration is over, so it fires in `SelfTest()`. |
| **Details is read-only** (§5.2 cl. 4) | **compile time** | `.Live()` takes `std::function<Fact()>` and has no `Bind` overload. |
| **`DisabledUnless` needs a reason** | **compile time** + runtime | no overload without the string; an empty string is the residual hole and is closed. |

**What happens when a law fires.** The project builds with `-fno-exceptions`,
so a violation cannot be thrown. The default handler prints and `abort()`s — a
malformed registry is a boot failure, not a runtime condition anyone handles.
`ui::LawRecorder` is the one seam that changes what happens *after* a violation
fires, never whether it fires; the tests install one so they can assert *which*
law caught the thing without terminating the binary. Nothing in the shipping
build constructs one.

### Left alignment is unrepresentable

`RowCtx` exposes `Place( widthBase )`, `PlacePx( widthPx )` and `PlaceFull()`.
None takes an x. Both public entry points route through one rect construction
whose `Max.x` is the lane's control edge, unconditionally, with no flag to
change it. There is no `Left()`, no `Centre()`, no `SameLine`, no
`SetCursorPosX`, and no atom touches ImGui's cursor — so a competing layout
system has nothing to act on even if someone called into it.

`SplitLabelZone()` returns the label rect and the value rect from **one**
subdivision, so the two cannot be computed inconsistently.

### The drawn-vs-hit-tested divergence (#23's bug class)

Two structural rules, both in `Controls.cpp`:

1. **One `ImRect` per atom.** `Begin()` registers the rect with `ItemAdd()` and
   hands the *same object* back for painting. An atom never recomputes its own
   geometry.
2. **The slider's handle is not a constant.** `SliderGrab()` is the only code
   in the kit that names a grab width. It pushes that width into
   `GrabMinSize`, calls `SliderBehavior()`, pops, and returns the grab rect
   `SliderBehavior` itself produced. `PaintSlider()` draws that rect and is
   never told how wide a handle should be. There is one number and the drawing
   code cannot see it, so a future edit moves the visible handle and the
   draggable target together or not at all.

The same shape covers the measured atoms: `MeasureCells()` is the single
function that decides how wide a segmented group or a chip bank is, and *both*
the "does it fit the lane" predicate and the per-cell layout read its output. A
control cannot be laid out to a width its own fit test never saw.

### Tests

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_overlay_ui.cpp` (`[overlay_ui]`) | token derivation across `display_scale` 0.5–2.0, the hairline floor rule, lane arithmetic against SPEC §8.3's worked example, the allocator's right-edge invariant, the label/value split, band quantisation, and every law made to **fire** |
| `tests/test_overlay_atoms.cpp` (`[overlay_atoms]`) | ImGui run headlessly — no window, no renderer. Asserts the registered hit box equals the allocated rect at four scales, that every atom leaves the style/colour/ID/item-flag stacks balanced, that a click lands on the lane rect and *not* where a left-aligned control would have been, and that `Choice` downgrades to a dropdown on all four of its conditions |

Both suites were verified to fail under a deliberate mutation (making `Place()`
left-bound) before being accepted.

**The harness needs one hack, recorded here so it is not mistaken for a
pattern:** `palette::g_LiveTheme` is defined in `Chrome.cpp`, so the test binary
defines the storage itself rather than linking 1,600 lines of legacy dock
machinery to read one float. The kit never reads that global — `ui::SetScale()`
is its one scale input — so this only satisfies `Palette.cpp`'s accent
recomputation.

### Deferred to later phases, deliberately

Not omissions; each has a reason.

- **The dropdown popup and the text field's validation plumbing.** `index.html`
  itself calls the popup "shell furniture, not a control atom". The closed
  states of both atoms are complete; the popup, its clipper and the
  Configure-hosted validation message belong to the shell (P2).
- **`Area::Repeat()`** (dynamic collections). It is a rebuild *policy*, not a
  foundation law, and it needs the shell's frame loop to have a topology-change
  hook to attach to.
- **`Cfg()`** — schema-backed bindings that know their destination file.
  `AnyBind` covers pointer and getter/setter binding today; `Cfg()` is the
  config seam and lands with P2, where `ConfigManager`'s write queue is wired.
- **`Escape()`** (API.md §13's migration seam) — it exists to host legacy panel
  bodies inside the sheet, which requires the sheet.
- **`ui_lint` / `ui_snapshot` / `--host=inline`.** They walk a *populated*
  registry; there are no areas until P3.

### Judgement calls

Recorded in `../../AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS.md` under **D11**, with the reasoning.
The two a reader is most likely to trip over:

- **`SPEC.md` §2.2's lane clamp is arithmetically self-contradictory** and was
  resolved against the mockup and §8.3's worked numbers. See `Lane.h`'s header
  comment for the full derivation.
- **The class is `ui::Parameter`, not `ui::Param`.** C++ forbids a member
  function whose name matches its enclosing class, and API.md §7's chained
  `.Param()` declarations require exactly that member. The concept and the laws
  are unchanged.

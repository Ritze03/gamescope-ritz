# SteamOS device tooling (`tools/`)

The shell scripts in `tools/` that build, deploy and reset Gamescope on a real SteamOS device over SSH.
Split out of [build-and-tooling.md](build-and-tooling.md) on 2026-11-07; the text below is moved verbatim.

- `tools/build_and_install_on_steamos_device_remote.sh` sources
  `steamos_common_remote.sh` for connection/credential setup, rsyncs the tree to the
  device (`copy_to_steamos_device_rsync.sh`), then SSHes in and runs the on-device
  counterpart `build_and_install_on_steamos_device_local.sh` (which actually invokes
  Meson/ninja on the device itself).
- `tools/steamos_sessionctl_remote.sh` takes a `<verb> <device_ip> [password]`, rsyncs the
  tree, then SSHes in to run `steamos_sessionctl_local.sh <verb>` on-device — used to
  control the running Gamescope session (start/stop/restart-style verbs) without a local
  build step.
- `tools/reset_to_system_gamescope_remote.sh` / `reset_to_system_gamescope_local.sh`
  revert a device back to its stock, package-provided Gamescope instead of the locally
  built one — the rollback counterpart to the install scripts.
- `steamos_common_remote.sh` / `steamos_common_local.sh` and
  `steamos_password_helpers.sh` hold the shared connection/credential plumbing (device IP,
  SSH invocation, credential handling) that every other `*_remote.sh`
  script sources first.
  *Why split into `_remote`/`_local` pairs:* the `_remote` script runs on the developer's
  machine and only handles getting bits onto the device and invoking SSH; the `_local`
  script is what actually executes on the SteamOS device itself, keeping the
  "what runs where" boundary explicit in the filenames rather than branching on hostname
  inside one script.
